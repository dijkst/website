BlueLock turns your iPhone into a key that can lock/unlock your Mac.

Strategy is quite simple:

>* One app for your Mac, and one for your iPhone.
* BlueLock automatically locks your Mac, when you walk away with your iPhone.
* Once you come back, it unlocks your Mac.

Features

>1. Simple: just a single button, which turns your iPhone into a key for your Mac.
2. Easy: fast connect, start the app on your Mac, click on one button in your iPhone to proceed.
3. No Worry: running in the background, you can turn off it from Background App Refresh.
4. Low Energy: Bluetooth 4.0, leave the app running all day long, cost lower power consumption than sending a single message.
5. Small Size: 500KB for iPhone and 1MB for the Mac, pretty much the smallest software among the similar section.
