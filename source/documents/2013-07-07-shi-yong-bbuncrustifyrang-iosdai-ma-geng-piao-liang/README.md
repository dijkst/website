uncrustify config for iOS developer

## What is it

uncrustify make code more beautifully. But uncrustify need some configs, and I not found a good configuration for iOS developer on Objective-C.

I hope that there is a repo can collect somebody's good style for iOS developer.

I hope somebody can distribute their configurations over pull request.

## Requirements

1. Tested with Xcode 4.6+ (also works in Xcode 5) on OS X 10.7 or higher.
- Uncrustify 0.60 higher (0.60 has a bug for Objective-C block, so install master HEAD or higher in the future)
- BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode

## Installation

1. using [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) install Uncrustify
```
brew install uncrustify --HEARD
```
- install [BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode](https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode/blob/master/README.md#installation)
- clone this repo and copy `uncrustify.cfg` to `~` or other folder as [BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode](https://github.com/benoitsan/BBUncrustifyPlugin-Xcode/blob/master/README.md#how-to-customize-the-uncrustify-configuration) said.

## Example

#### align code:

before:
``` objective-c
NSString *const BBUncrustifyOptionEvictCommentInsertion = @"evictCommentInsertion";
NSString *const BBUncrustifyOptionSourceFilename = @"sourceFilename";
NSString *const BBUncrustifyOptionSupplementalConfigurationFolders = @"supplementalConfigurationFolders";
```
after:
``` objective-c
NSString *const BBUncrustifyOptionEvictCommentInsertion            = @"evictCommentInsertion";
NSString *const BBUncrustifyOptionSourceFilename                   = @"sourceFilename";
NSString *const BBUncrustifyOptionSupplementalConfigurationFolders = @"supplementalConfigurationFolders";
```

#### remove space:

before:
``` objective-c
-( void )viewWillEnter ;
```
after:
``` objective-c
- (void)viewWillEnter;
```

#### insert newline between methods

``` objective-c
- (void)a {
}
- (void)b{
}
```
after:
``` objective-c
- (void)a {
}

- (void)b {
}
```

and so on.
